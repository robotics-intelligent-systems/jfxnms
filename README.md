# Network Management System

SONiC (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) is a free and open-source network operating system based on Linux that runs on switches from multiple vendors and ASICs. SONiC offers a full-suite of network functionality, like BGP and RDMA, that has been production-hardened in the data centers of some of the largest cloud-service providers. OpenWISP is an open-source solution for efficient IT network deployment, monitoring & management. NMS PRIME is an Open Source Network Provisioning Tool and Network Management Platform that enables access across multiple access technologies/domains, like DOCSIS, FTTH, FTTx, DSL and WiFi. It allows a seamless user experience across multiple connectivity services. It reduces complexity for network operators through a simple and easy to adapt application marketplace. ONOS is the only SDN controller platform that supports the transition from legacy “brown field” networks to SDN “green field” networks. OpenWrt is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers). Unlike many other distributions for routers, OpenWrt is built from the ground up to be a full-featured, easily modifiable operating system for embedded devices. In practice, this means that you can have all the features you need with none of the bloat, powered by a modern Linux kernel. IP Infusion offers an open and disaggregated network operating system called OcNOS (Open Compute Network Operating System). Designed for white box and disaggregated hardware, OcNOS provides a flexible and scalable solution for commercial and service provider networks.
